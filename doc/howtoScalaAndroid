Getting Started with Scala for Android on Archlinux             Maarten Faddegon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Install packages ==

First we need to install the Eclipse, Scala and the Android tools.

Eclipse and Scala are the the official repositories, we can install with:
    $ pacman -S eclipse scala

The android tools and some useful android plugins can be found in the AUR.  We
need at least the following tools: android-sdk, android-udev,
eclipse-androidproguardscala, eclipse-android, eclipse-emf, eclipse-gef
eclipse-scala-ide, eclipse-wtp, android-sdk-build-tools,
android-sdk-platform-tools, android-platform-16, android-support.
Version 16 of android-platform matches Android 4.1, the version on my phone,
we need to install other versions as well if we want to target different
android versions. You may need to install some depencies from the official
repositories too. To install a package, you need to download the tarball and
issue the following commands. (Read more about installing from AUR on the
archwiki. [1])
    $ tar -xzf <package>.tar.gz
    $ cd <package>
    $ cat PKGBUILD # to inspect nothing weird is done
    $ makepkg 
    $ sudo pacman -U <package><version>.pkg.tar.xz 

Afterwards we need to add some links for backward compatibility [4]:
    $ cd /opt/android-sdk/platform-tools
    $ sudo ln -s ../build-tools/17.0.0/{lib,aidl,aapt} .

== First app In Eclipse ==

When we start Eclipse for the first time it needs to reconfigure itself
because of the installed plugins. We may also need to tell it that the
android sdk is installed in /opt/android-sdk/.

We start with creating a normal Java app to test our setup. For this we
just follow Googles instructions. [2] Note that after the setup is complete we
may still need to close "Welcome" page.
After following the first 2 lessons, we now should have run a first hello
world on our Android device.

== First Scala app in Eclipse ==

Use the following 2 steps from [3] on the "My First App" project we created in
the previous section:
 o Right-click on the project, Configure, Add Scala nature
 o Right-click on the project, Add AndroidProguardScala nature

Now we can replace the java main wit a scala class:
 o Delete MainActivity.java
 o Right-click on the package, new, other, Scala Class, name it MainActity

And put the following code in the newly created MainActivity.scala:
    package faddegonbros.myfirstapp
    import android.app.Activity
    import android.os.Bundle
    class MainActivity extends Activity
    {
        override def onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle)
        {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        }
    }

We should be able to compile and run the app again.

== First Scalaoid App without Eclipse ==

We take an example project from github:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pocorall/hello-scaloid-maven.git

We need to update pom.xml to point to the sdk. Maven also needs some links
in order to find some build tools (described above).
        <sdk>
    +           <path>/opt/android-sdk</path>
                <platform>8</platform>
        </sdk>

Now we can build a package and send it to our Android device.

    $ mvn clean package
    $ mvn android:deploy
